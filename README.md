[Created for CSUN Coding Competition 2020]
```

# Objectives of the project:
```
1. Create a bot on Discord and tailor it to our needs.
2. Have the bot follow users in/out voice channels.
3. Make the bot listen to different voice channels on Discord server.
4. Transcribe speech to text using Artifical Intelligence (Speech Recognition).
5. Send the transcribed results in a private message to each user using the service.
6. Self-destruct all messages after 20 seconds of generation for privacy protection.

[All objectives have been achieved successfully.]

## This project utilizes the following resources:
```
- JavaScript.
- Discord API - Discord.js
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
```

# How to use:
```
- Get invited into the Discord server.

- To make the bot stop listening to you and send you transcribed text type: !opt out
(You will be greeted in sign language).
```

# Help:
```
Type !help in the Discord chat to get bot help commands.
```

# Testing, functionality, and user experience:
```
- The bot's functionality has been fully tested out with a hard of hearing user.
- The user confirmed functionality and results.
- The user was satisfied with the overall experience.
```

# Future Work:
```
- Add Speech to ASL feature.
- Discord/Google overlay.
- Send responses in multiple channels inside the bot.
- Make it accessible for all servers.
- Possibly creating a text log.
- Testing it further in groups with hard of hearing users.
